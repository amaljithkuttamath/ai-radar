# AI Radar

What changed in AI, in plain words. A new edition every morning, ranked by what is new and
what matters, with every link checked against its source.

### New in the last two days · Fri 13 Nov

> The strongest signal today is PhysLoop, a PKU-led framework that uses LLMs’ physics knowledge to generate self-correcting training data for video models, paired with NVIDIA’s practical guide to serving frontier models (GLM-5.3) across two DGX Stations via vLLM. Together they highlight a convergence: research pushing physical plausibility in generation, and engineering solving the multi-node serving that such models demand.

_A quiet day: nothing new cleared the bar. Still unfolding is below._

## Want a radar for another topic?

AI Radar is a template. Fork it, point `config/sources.yaml` at the feeds you care about,
describe your interests in `config/profile.yaml`, and add a model API key as a repository
secret. Your own radar publishes the next morning. Try it first with no keys at all:

```bash
uv sync --locked && uv run python -m radar demo
```

## How stories are picked

Each story is ranked by **importance × freshness × relevance**. Importance counts evidence
you can check (a frontier lab's own announcement, a usable artifact, a concrete result, and
traction gained recently rather than all-time totals). Freshness fades a story day by day,
so new developments lead and older ones move to "Still unfolding". Relevance follows the
interests in the profile. Details in [distill/news.py](distill/news.py).

**Sources (40+):** arXiv (machine learning, language, AI, robotics, vision), Hugging Face
papers and trending, GitHub trending, Hacker News; the labs themselves (OpenAI, Anthropic,
Google DeepMind, Google AI, Meta AI, Mistral, Microsoft Research, Apple, Amazon, NVIDIA,
AMD, Hugging Face, AWS, Berkeley AI Research, MIT); press (TechCrunch, MIT Technology
Review, IEEE Spectrum); expert writers (Simon Willison, Import AI, Latent Space,
Interconnects, One Useful Thing, Ahead of AI, Lil'Log, Eugene Yan); and policy and safety
(AI Alignment Forum, CSET). The full list is in [config/sources.yaml](config/sources.yaml).
